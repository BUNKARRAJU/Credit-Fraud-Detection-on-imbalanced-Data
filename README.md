# Credit-Fraud-Detection-on-imbalanced-Data
In this project we will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud. As described in the dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), the features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons.
